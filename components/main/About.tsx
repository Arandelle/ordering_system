                  Everyone has that one brother who runs the grill at every
                  gathering — steady hand, serious tongs, always cracking jokes.
                  That's Harrison.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He's not the loudest in the family, but he's the one people
                  gather around. Over the years, his inihaw became legend among
                  friends and neighbors — not because it was fancy, but because
                  it was exactly what you needed, when you needed it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "You should open a place, Harrison," he finally did. Now, he's
                  grilling for everyone. Still with the same care. Still doing
                  the first flip.
